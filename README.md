## What other cool stuff is in here?

The default [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) layout is based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), and is fully commented. (Don't worry, those comments aren't rendered out to your build directory)

[Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) is the default grid system.

An included Ruby helper method to generate image placeholders, powered by [Holder.js](http://imsky.github.com/holder/).
